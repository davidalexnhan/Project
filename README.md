Pong Game Documentation
Introduction

Pong is a classic arcade game that simulates table tennis. This documentation provides an overview of a simple Pong game implemented in C++. The game features two paddles and a ball that bounces between them. The objective is to prevent the ball from hitting the walls behind the paddles.
Implementation Details
Dependencies

    iostream: Standard C++ library for input/output operations.
    conio.h: Library for console input/output operations.
    windows.h: Windows-specific library for console manipulation.

Functions
SetConsoleWindowSize(int width, int height)

    Description: Sets the console window size.
    Parameters:
        width: Width of the console window.
        height: Height of the console window.

SetCursorPosition(int x, int y)

    Description: Sets the cursor position in the console.
    Parameters:
        x: X-coordinate of the cursor position.
        y: Y-coordinate of the cursor position.

main()

    Description: The main function that runs the Pong game.
    Variables:
        width: Width of the game window.
        height: Height of the game window.
        paddleWidth: Width of the paddles.
        paddleHeight: Height of the paddles.
        ballPositionX: X-coordinate of the ball's position.
        ballPositionY: Y-coordinate of the ball's position.
        ballDirectionX: Horizontal direction of the ball (-1 for left, 1 for right).
        ballDirectionY: Vertical direction of the ball (-1 for up, 1 for down).
        player1PositionY: Y-coordinate of player 1's paddle.
        player2PositionY: Y-coordinate of player 2's paddle.
        player1Score: Player 1's score.
        player2Score: Player 2's score.

Game Loop

    The game loop continuously updates and renders the game elements until the game is exited.
    The loop performs the following steps:
        Clear the screen.
        Draw the paddles on the screen.
        Draw the ball on the screen.
        Draw the score on the screen.
        Move the ball.
        Handle ball collision with paddles.
        Handle ball collision with walls.

How to Run the Game

    Set up a C++ development environment with a compatible compiler.
    Copy the provided code into a new C++ source file (e.g., "pong.cpp").
    Compile and build the code using the C++ compiler.
    Run the generated executable to start the Pong game.
    Use the arrow keys or custom controls to move the paddles and hit the ball.
    The game ends when the ball hits either wall behind the paddles.
    The final scores of both players are displayed.

Conclusion

This documentation has provided an overview of a simple Pong game implemented in C++. It covers the code structure, dependencies, functions, game loop, and instructions to run the game. Feel free to modify and enhance the code to add additional features and improve the gameplay experience. Enjoy playing Pong!

Please note that this is a simplified version of Pong, and more advanced features like game modes, AI opponents, and graphical user interfaces can be added to enhance the game further.
